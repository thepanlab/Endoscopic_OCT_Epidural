# README

Code for the paper to be published in a future paper. The following pieces of python code and jupyter notebooks were used for the paper. The following architectures were used: 
* Resnet 50
* InceptionV3
* Xception

# Prerequisites

The language used is Python. We used Tensorflow 2.3.

# Structure:
* *0a-Read_images.ipynb* <br>
    It process the images for tissues: fat, ligament, flavum ,and spinal cord from JPEG to numpy binary files

* *0b-Read_new_class.ipynb* <br>
    It process the images for epidural space (empty) from JPEG to numpy binary files

* *0c-Join_datasets.ipynb* <br>
    It concatenates the ndarray binaries from 0a and 0b.
